## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The SuperLearner Article resonated well with me as a good reminder for forming good learning habits. I especially
liked the idea that "reading is to the mind what exercise is to your body" as an encouragement to read a lot.
**Things I already do**
+ View learning as a process
+ Take care of my brain
+ Harbor a growth mindset
**Things I want to start doing or do more of**
+ Teach others
+ Read more
+ Take more short breaks early and often
+ Improve brain health habits
+ Be patient with reaching that 'end goal' i.e. keep revisiting the "process"
